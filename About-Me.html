    <h4>Hi Everybody</h4>
<body>
<p>  My name is Francesca Schorer, I am a Graphic Communication major with an Integrated Marketing Communications minor. I have always been a big fan of palying around in the outdoors, skiing, hiking, wakeboarding, and anything else that will get my endless energy out. There has always been a love of fashion which dreamed through the beautiful spreads of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar.  </p>
