<p>  My name is Francesca Schorer, I am a Graphic Communication major with an Integrated Marketing Communications minor. I have always been a big fan of playing around in the outdoors, skiing, hiking, wakeboarding, and anything else that will get my endless energy out. There has always been a love of fashion which dreamed through the beautiful spreads of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. Bringing these two joys together is what I love to do. A few of my other favorite things include: Younglife, dancing- line or other, my crazy friends and family, Emma Watson, How I Met Your Mother, lakes, and my mom's cookies.   </p>
